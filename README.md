# OIBSIP_DataAnalytics_task3 (Wine Quality Prediction)
## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using machine learning techniques based on its chemical properties. The dataset contains various numerical attributes such as acidity, sugar content, pH, sulphates, and alcohol level, which play an important role in determining wine quality.

The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset, preprocess the data, and build a predictive model that can estimate wine quality based on these features.

## Dataset
The project uses a wine quality dataset containing chemical characteristics of wine samples along with their corresponding quality scores.

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure
2. Performed data preprocessing and feature selection
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
4. Trained a machine learning model to predict wine quality
5. Evaluated the model using appropriate performance metrics
6. Analyzed the results to understand model performance

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## Model Evaluation
The model performance was evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to measure prediction accuracy and overall effectiveness.

## Conclusion
The wine quality prediction model was able to learn the relationship between chemical properties and wine quality with reasonable accuracy. This project provided practical experience in data preprocessing, supervised machine learning, and model evaluation. It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world datasets to make meaningful predictions.

## Future Scope
The model performance can be further improved by experimenting with different algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, or applying advanced feature selection techniques.
